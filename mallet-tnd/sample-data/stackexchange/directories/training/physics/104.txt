 Sun and Earth interact through gravity. Sun exert a gravitational force on Earth and ... Earth exert and equal and opposite force on Sun (or is it the opposite ?). Opposite here does not mean "sci-fi anti gravity force repelling objects" but opposite as in "vector of opposite direction and equal magnitude". The centrifugal force is not a force, but a pseudo force that is introduced because the referential frame is not inertial. In the referential frame where you need to introduce the centifugal force, the "opposite reaction" is the centripedal force itself. To solve the Earth around the Sun problem, first consider that the sun as an infinite mass and is thus without motion. The sun exert a force on Earth, and in some frame of reference you need to introduce an additional pseudo-force. Edit: The gravitational field "generated" by Earth is weaker, but the forces are equal (in magnitude). $E_{earth} = \frac{G m_{earth}}{r^2}$ $E_{sun} = \frac{G m_{sun}}{r^2}$ $F = E_{earth} * m_{sun} = E_{sun} * m_{earth}$ Another edit: Considering the title of your question "is gravity a force": Gravity is one of the four fundamental interaction of nature (strong and weak interactions, and electromagnetism). No complete treatment of this interaction exists at a quantum level, so from a classical point of view, yes gravity is a force, associated with a conservative [gravitational] field, etc.
