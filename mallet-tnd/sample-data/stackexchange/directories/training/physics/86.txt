 I think you answered your question. "According to EPR experiments measurements of the entangled states are at odds with SR": if you mean that we cannot consider that the result of a measurement made on one entangled particle "propagates" to another one because this propagation would violate SR principles, you have to rules out a interaction in the sense of "strong, weak, ... interaction", ie an interaction not in violation with SR. In addition, we do not need to have such an interaction as it is directly explained by the principles of quantum mechanics. It is like imagining that an "interaction" teaches QM to the particles. The main outcome of the treatments of the EPR paradox is to make hidden variables theories irrelevant, so basically "quantum mechanics" wins and we don't need other explanations.
