 By 'Newton's Law of Gravity', I am referring to The magnitude of the force of gravity is proportional to the product of the mass of the two objects and inversely proportional to their distance squared. Does this law of attraction still hold under General Relativity's Tensor Equations? I don't really know enough about mathematics to be able to solve any of Einstein's field equations, but does Newton's basic law of the magnitude of attraction still hold? If they are only approximations, what causes them to differ?
