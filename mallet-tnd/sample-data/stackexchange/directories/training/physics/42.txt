 The notes from week 1 of John Baez's course in Lagrangian mechanics ( ) give some insight into the motivations for action principles. The idea is that least action might be considered an extension of the principle of virtual work. When an object is in equilibrium, it takes zero work to make an arbitrary small displacement on it. I.E. the dot product of any small displacement vector and the force is zero (in this case because the force itself is zero). When an object is accelerating, if we add in an "inertial force" equal to -m*a, then a small, arbitrary, time-dependent displacement from the objects true trajectory would again have zero dot product with F-ma, the true force and inertial force added. This gives $(F-ma)\cdot \delta q(t) = 0$ From there, a few calculations found in the notes lead to the stationary action integral. Baez discusses D'Alembert more than Hamilton, but either way it's an interesting look into the origins of the idea.
