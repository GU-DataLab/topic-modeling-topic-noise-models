 When 235U captures a neutron, it forms the compound state 236U*, the excitation energy is given by To find the energy of the compound state, the mass energies of 235U and n can be used - assuming that the neutron will be thermalised for this reaction to occur and thus it's kinetic energy is negligible. Thus: This causes a fission event to occur, which can produce over twenty different products, one example is: The energy liberated is defined by the Q value: the initial mass energy minus the final mass energy Using the masses of 93Rb (92.92172u) and 141Cs (140.91949u)
