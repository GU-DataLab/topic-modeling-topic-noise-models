 The opposite is that Earth attracts the sun with the same exact force! Thinking smaller, the Earth attracts you and you attract the earth with forces that are equal in magnitude and direction, but of opposite sense. Of course, by Newton second's law, that same force will have a much greater effect on you than on the Earth. The same applies to the Earth+Sun combination!
