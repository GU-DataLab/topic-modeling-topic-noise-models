 To accelerate particles to very high energies, you need a long path, because the force is limited (just as in case of an airplane runway). You run them in circles to have it confined, or you would have to build something the size of a solar system. There are, however, what is called Linear Accelerators, like SLAC. These are used to accelerate electrons, which are too light to be run in circles. They radiate a lot of energy when pushed sideways.
