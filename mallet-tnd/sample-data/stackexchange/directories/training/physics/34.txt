 The difficulty is that since the trip at 40mph takes longer, you spend more time going 40mph than you do going 60mph, so the average speed is weighted more heavily towards 40 mph. When calculating average speeds for fixed distances, it is better think of everything in minutes per mile rather than miles per hour. 60 miles per hour is 1 minute per mile, while 40 miles per hour is 1.5 minutes per mile. Since we travel the same number of miles at each speed, we can now take the mean of these two figures. That's 1.25 minutes per mile on average. For 240 miles total, 240miles*1.25minutes/mile = 300 minutes = 5 hours. This method is called finding the "harmonic mean" of the speeds.
