 I'm assuming that what I've been told is true: We can only detect pulsars if their beams of electromagnetic radiation is directed towards Earth. That pulsars are the same as neutron stars, only that they emit beams of EM radiation out of their magnetic poles. So, isn't it possible that neutron stars emit EM radiation in the same fashion as pulsars, just not in the right direction for us to detect it?
