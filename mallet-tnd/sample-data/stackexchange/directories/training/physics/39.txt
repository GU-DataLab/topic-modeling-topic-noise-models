 As is said in a comment, the reasoning in the first paragraph is correct but the one in the second paragraph is wrong. If you apply a force on something without "moving" the work is null and there is no energy exchange involved (this is not the same thing than doing that with your muscles, but that's another story :p). ( Work = integral[a to b] of F dot dx ; so Work = 0 if there is not "circulation"). Thus the magnets do not need any energy to statically counteract the force. However, if you do move the magnets, then you need to give some energy. This energy is stored in the system because you cause a variation of magnetic flux: magnet 1 moving induce a variation of flux seen by magnet 2, and this will change the state of magnet 2, increasing its potential energy.
