 Neutrons consist of quarks that are electrically charged, so when two neutrons get close enough to each other the higher electrical multipole moments will become relevant and cause repelling. But also note the magnetic moment and the strong force Cedric mentioned plus the Pauli exclusion mentioned by nibot.
