 Cyclotrons, while generally economic because of the reduced space and cost to build (compared to linear accelerators), suffer from two notable problems. Note that the LHC is in fact a synchotron , which is notably improved over a cyclotron for relativistic (high energy) particles. The following principles still apply pretty well, however. The magnetic field required to impart the centripetal acceleration on the particle to keep it in orbit is inversely proportional to the radius of orbit. Creating stronger magnetic fields requires larger and much more costly magnets. Maximising the radius of orbit helps reduce the required strength of magnetic field. Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism indicate that an accelerating charge loses energy by emitting radiation. In fact, if you do the maths, this introduces the limit on the maximum velocity/energy of any accelerated particle. The larger the radius, the lower the centripetal force/acceleration, hence the lower the rate of energy loss. To illustrate point 1, the force on a charged particle is given as $$F = Bqv$$ where B is the magnetic field strength. And the centripetal force on a charge is given as $$F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$ where r is the radius of the particle accelerator tunnel from the centre of the orbit. Equating the two gives $$B = \frac{mv}{qr} = \frac{m\omega}{q}$$ Clearly, increasing the radius $r$ requires a lower $B$ (magnetic field). Point 2 is slightly more involved to show, as one has to apply Maxwell's equations and calculate the energy flux emitted. Hopefully you get the point however.
