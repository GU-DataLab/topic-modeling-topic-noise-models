 String theory, was constructed with the idea that at low energies it should reduce to the quantum mechanical and particle world that we see every day. This is analogous to the correspondence principle in quantum mechanics. In some sense, any experiment that discredits quantum mechanics will cause a serious re-examination of string theory, however, as many experimentalists will joke, a theorist will always find a way to fix his theory to match the observations. In any case, quantum theory seems very well supported and is unlikely that it will be discredited any time soon Direct tests of string theory, however, will have to wait until we can probe much higher energies.
