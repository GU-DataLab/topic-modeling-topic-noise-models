 Loosely speaking, (super)string theory considers additional spatial dimensions that are "wrapped up" (have unusual topologies of high curvature, I believe). Now it is of course complete speculation, but if these dimensions do exist, electromagnetism would not spread out much into those dimensions, hence it would appear as if there are only three dimensions still (to a very good approximation). Saying that, your argument is more or less sound (though far from bulletproof). It certainly suggests we don't live in a 2D world, and that any possible extra dimensions are comparatively very small!
