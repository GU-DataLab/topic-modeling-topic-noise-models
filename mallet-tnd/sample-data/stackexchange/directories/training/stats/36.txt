 There is an old saying: "Correlation does not mean causation". When I teach, I tend to use the following standard examples to illustrate this point: number of storks and birth rate in Denmark; number of priests in America and alcoholism; in the start of the 20th century it was noted that there was a strong correlation between 'Number of radios' and 'Number of people in Insane Asylums' and my favorite: pirates cause global warming . However, I do not have any references for these examples and whilst amusing, they are obviously false. Does anyone have any other good examples?
