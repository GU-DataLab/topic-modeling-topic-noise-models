 Yes, there are many methods. You would need to specify which model you're using, because it can vary. For instance, Some models will be compared based on the AIC or BIC criteria. In other cases, one would look at the MSE from cross validation (as, for instance, with a support vector machine). I recommend reading Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop. This is also discussed in Chapter 5 on Credibility, and particularly section 5.5 "Comparing data mining methods" of Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques by Witten and Frank (which discusses Weka in detail). Lastly, you should also have a look at The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman which is available for free online.
