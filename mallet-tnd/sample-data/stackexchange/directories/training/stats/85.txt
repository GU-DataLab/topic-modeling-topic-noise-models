 A random variable is a variable whose value depends on unknown events. We can summarize the unknown events as "state", and then the random variable is a function of the state. Example: Suppose we have three dice rolls (D1,D2,D3). Then the state S=(D1,D2,D3). One random variable X is the number of 5s. X=(D1==5?)+(D2==5?)+(D3==5?). Another random variable Y is the sum of the dice rolls Y=D1+D2+D3.
