 A standard deviation is the square root of the second central moment of a distribution. A central moment is the expected difference from the expected value of the distribution. A first central moment would usually be 0, so we define a second central moment as the expected value of the squared distance of a random variable from its expected value. To put it on a scale that is more in line with the original observations, we take the square root of that second central moment and call it the standard deviation. Standard deviation is a property of a population. It measures how much average "dispersion" there is to that population. Are all the obsrvations clustered around the mean, or are they widely spread out? To estimate the standard deviation of a population, we often calculate the standard deviation of a "sample" from that population. To do this, you take observations from that population, calculate a mean of those observations, and then calculate the square root of the average squared deviation from that "sample mean". To get an unbiased estimator of the variance, you don't actually calculate the average squared deviation from the sample mean, but instead, you divide by (N-1) where N is the number of observations in your sample. Note that this "sample standard deviation" is not an unbiased estimator of the standard deviation, but the square of the "sample standard deviation" is an unbiased estimator of the variance of the population.
