 With the recent FIFA world cup, I decided to have some fun and determine which months produced world cup football players. Turned out, most footballers in the 2010 world cup were born in the first half of the year. Someone pointed out, that children born in the first half of the year had a physical advantage over others and hence "survivorship bias" was involved in the equation. Is this an accurate observation? Can someone please explain why he says that? Also, when trying to understand the concept, I found most examples revolved around the financial sector. Are they any other everyday life examples explaining it? Thanks!
