 K-Means clustering should work well for this type of problem. However, it does require that you specify the number of clusters in advance. Given the nature of this data, however, you may be able to work with a hierarchical clustering algorithm instead. Since all 4 variables are most likely fairly highly correlated, you can most likely break out clusters, and stop when you reach a small enough distance between clusters. This may be a much simpler approach in this specific case, and allows you to determine "how many clusters" by just stopping as soon as you've broken your set into fine enough clusters.
