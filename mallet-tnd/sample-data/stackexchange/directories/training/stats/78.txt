 You tend to use the covariance matrix when the variable scales are similar and the correlation matrix when variables are on different scales. Using the correlation matrix standardises the data. In general they give different results. Especially when the scales are different. As an example, take a look at this R data set. Some of the variables have an average value of about 1.8 (the high jump), whereas other variables (run 800m) are around 120. This outputs: Now let's do PCA on covariance and on correlation: Notice that PCA on covariance is dominated by and : PC1 is almost equal to (and explains $82\%$ of the variance) and PC2 is almost equal to (together they explain $97\%$). PCA on correlation is much more informative and reveals some structure in the data and relationships between variables (but note that the explained variances drop to $64\%$ and $71\%$). Notice also that the outlying individuals (in this data set) are outliers regardless of whether the covariance or correlation matrix is used.
