 From Wikipedia : In mathematics (especially probability theory and statistics), a random variable (or stochastic variable) is (in general) a measurable function that maps a probability space into a measurable space. Random variables mapping all possible outcomes of an event into the real numbers are frequently studied in elementary statistics and used in the sciences to make predictions based on data obtained from scientific experiments. In addition to scientific applications, random variables were developed for the analysis of games of chance and stochastic events. The utility of random variables comes from their ability to capture only the mathematical properties necessary to answer probabilistic questions. From cnx.org : A random variable is a function, which assigns unique numerical values to all possible outcomes of a random experiment under fixed conditions. A random variable is not a variable but rather a function that maps events to numbers.
