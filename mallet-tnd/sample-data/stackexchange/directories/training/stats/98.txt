 Eliciting priors is a tricky business. Statistical Methods for Eliciting Probability Distributions and Eliciting Probability Distributions are quite good practical guides for prior elicitation. The process in both papers is outlined as follows: background and preparation; identifying and recruiting the expert(s); motivation and training the expert(s); structuring and decomposition (typically deciding precisely what variables should be elicited, and how to elicit joint distributions in the multivariate case); the elicitation itself. Of course, they also review how the elicitation results in information that may be fit to or otherwise define distributions (for instance, in the Bayesian context, Beta distributions ), but quite importantly, they also address common pitfalls in modeling expert knowledge (anchoring, narrow and small-tailed distributions, etc.).
