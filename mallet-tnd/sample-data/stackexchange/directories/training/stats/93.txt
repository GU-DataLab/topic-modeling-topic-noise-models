 We're trying to use a Gaussian process to model h(t) -- the hazard function -- for a very small initial population, and then fit that using the available data. While this gives us nice plots for credible sets for h(t) and so on, it unfortunately is also just pushing the inference problem from h(t) to the covariance function of our process. Perhaps predictably, we have several reasonable and equally defensible guesses for this that all produce different result. Has anyone run across any good approaches for addressing such a problem? Gaussian-process related or otherwise?
