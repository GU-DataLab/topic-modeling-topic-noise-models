 Machine Learning seems to have its basis in the pragmatic - a Practical observation or simulation of reality. Even within statistics, mindless "checking of models and assumptions" can lead to discarding methods that are useful. For example, years ago, the very first commercially available (and working) Bankruptcy model implemented by the credit bureaus was created through a plain old linear regression model targeting a 0-1 outcome. Technically, that's a bad approach, but practically, it worked.
