 I recommend these books - they are highly rated on Amazon too: "Text Mining" by Weiss "Text Mining Application Programming", by Konchady For software, I recommend RapidMiner (with the text plugin), free and open-source. This is my "text mining process": Then you can start the work of classifying them. kNN, SVM, or Naive Bayes as appropriate. You can see my series of text mining videos here
