 Start with the distribution of $\bar{y}$, show that since $v$ is normal, $\bar{y}$ is multivariate normal and that consequently $u$ must also be a multivariate normal; also show that the covariance matrix of $\bar{y}$ is of the form $\sigma^2\cdot(X^T X)^{-1}$ and thus -- if $\sigma^2$ were known -- the variance of $u$ would be $\sigma^2 c^T (X^T X)^{-1} c$. Show that the distribution of $\bar{e}^T \bar{e}$ must be chi-squared and ( carefully ) find the degrees of freedom. Think about how what the operation $\bar{e}^T \bar{e} c^T (X^T X)^{-1} c$ must therefore produce, and what it's distribution and degrees of freedom are. The result follows (almost) immediately from the definition of the t-distribution.
