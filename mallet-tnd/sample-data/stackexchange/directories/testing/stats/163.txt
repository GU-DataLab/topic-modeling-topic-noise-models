 Definition: A random variable is a measurable function from a probability space into a measurable space known as the state space. Example: Lets say I roll a fair six-sided die, with outcomes being one of the following: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Whichever number the die lands on is the number of free text-books I will give you. In this case, the final amount of free text books that I give you is the random variable because its value is based on the outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 free text books) of a random event (rolling the die) and is not known before I roll the die.
