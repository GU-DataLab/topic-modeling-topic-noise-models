 I had a plan of learning R in the near future. Reading another question I found out about Clojure. Now I don't know what to do. I think a big advantage of R for me is that some people in Economics use it, including one of my supervisors (though the other said: stay away from R!). One advantage of Clojure is that it is Lisp-based, and as I have started learning Emacs and I am keen on writing my own customisations, it would be helpful (yeah, I know Clojure and Elisp are different dialects of Lisp, but they are both Lisp and thus similar I would imagine). I can't ask which one is better, because I know this is very personal, but could someone give me the advantages (or advantages) of Clojure x R, especially in practical terms? For example, which one should be easier to learn, which one is more flexible or more powerful, which one has more libraries, more support, more users, etc? My intended use : The bulk of my estimation should be done using Matlab, so I am not looking for anything too deep in terms of statistical analysis, but rather a software to substitute Excel for the initial data manipulation and visualisation, summary statistics and charting, but also some basic statistical analysis or the initial attempts at my estimation.
