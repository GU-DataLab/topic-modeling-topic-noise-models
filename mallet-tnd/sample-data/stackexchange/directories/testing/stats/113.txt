 I have been looking into theoretical frameworks for method selection (note: not model selection) and have found very little systematic, mathematically-motivated work. By 'method selection', I mean a framework for distinguishing the appropriate (or better, optimal) method with respect to a problem, or problem type. What I have found is substantial, if piecemeal, work on particular methods and their tuning (i.e. prior selection in Bayesian methods), and method selection via bias selection (e.g. Inductive Policy: The Pragmatics of Bias Selection ). I may be unrealistic at this early stage of machine learning's development, but I was hoping to find something like what measurement theory does in prescribing admissible transformations and tests by scale type, only writ large in the arena of learning problems. Any suggestions?
