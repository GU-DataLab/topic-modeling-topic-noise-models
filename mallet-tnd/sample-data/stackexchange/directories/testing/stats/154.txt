 I am currently researching the trial roulette method for my masters thesis as an elicitation technique. This is a graphical method that allows an expert to represent her subjective probability distribution for an uncertain quantity. Experts are given counters (or what one can think of as casino chips) representing equal densities whose total would sum up to 1 - for example 20 chips of probability = 0.05 each. They are then instructed to arrange them on a pre-printed grid, with bins representing result intervals. Each column would represent their belief of the probability of getting the corresponding bin result. Example: A student is asked to predict the mark in a future exam. The figure below shows a completed grid for the elicitation of a subjective probability distribution. The horizontal axis of the grid shows the possible bins (or mark intervals) that the student was asked to consider. The numbers in top row record the number of chips per bin. The completed grid (using a total of 20 chips) shows that the student believes there is a 30% chance that the mark will be between 60 and 64.9. Some reasons in favour of using this technique are: Many questions about the shape of the expert's subjective probability distribution can be answered without the need to pose a long series of questions to the expert - the statistician can simply read off density above or below any given point, or that between any two points. During the elicitation process, the experts can move around the chips if unsatisfied with the way they placed them initially - thus they can be sure of the final result to be submitted. It forces the expert to be coherent in the set of probabilities that are provided. If all the chips are used, the probabilities must sum to one. Graphical methods seem to provide more accurate results, especially for participants with modest levels of statistical sophistication.
