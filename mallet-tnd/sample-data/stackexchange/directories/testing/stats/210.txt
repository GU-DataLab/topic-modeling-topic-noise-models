 Data is always discrete. Given a sample of values on a variable, the maximum number of distinct values the variable can take is equal to . See this quote All actual sample spaces are discrete, and all observable random variables have discrete distributions. The continuous distribution is a mathematical construction, suitable for mathematical treatment, but not practically observable. E.J.G. Pitman (1979, p. 1). Data on a variable are typically assumed to be drawn from a random variable. The random variable is continuous over a range if there is an infinite number of possible values that the variable can take between any two different points in the range. For example, height, weight, and time are typically assumed to be continuous. Of course, any measurement of these variables will be finitely accurate and in some sense discrete. It is useful to distinguish between ordered (i.e., ordinal), unordered (i.e., nominal), and binary discrete variables. Some introductory textbooks confuse a continuous variable with a numeric variable. For example, a score on a computer game is discrete even though it is numeric. Some introductory textbooks confuse a ratio variable with continuous variables. A count variable is a ratio variable, but it is not continuous. In actual practice, a variable is often treated as continuous when it can take on a sufficiently large number of different values. References Pitman, E. J. G. 1979.
