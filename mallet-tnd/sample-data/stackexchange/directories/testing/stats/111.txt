 In R, the default setting for random number generation are: For U(0,1), use the Mersenne-Twister algorithm For Guassian numbers use the numerical inversion of the standard normal distribution function. You can easily check this, viz. It is possible to change the default generator to other PRNGs, such as Super-Duper,Wichmann-Hill, Marsaglia-Multicarry or even a user-supplied PRNG. See the ?RNGkind for further details. I have never needed to change the default PRNG. The C GSL library also uses the Mersenne-Twister by default.
