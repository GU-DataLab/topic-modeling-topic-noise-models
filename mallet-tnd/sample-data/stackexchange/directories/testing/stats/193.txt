 Suppose that you want to know what percentage of people would vote for a particular candidate (say, $\pi$, note that by definition $\pi$ is between 0 and 100). You sample $N$ voters at random to find out how they would vote and your survey of these $N$ voters tells you that the percentage is $p$. So, you would like to establish a confidence interval for the true percentage. If you assume that $p$ is normally distributed (an assumption that may or may not be justified depending on how 'big' $N$ is) then your confidence interval for $\pi$ would be of the following form: $$ CI = [ p - k * sd(p),~~ p + k * sd(p)] $$ where $k$ is a constant that depends on the extent of confidence you want (i.e., 95% or 99% etc). From a polling perspective, you want the width of your confidence interval to be 'low'. Usually, pollsters work with the margin of error which is basically one-half of the CI. In other words, $\text{MoE} = k * sd(p)$. Here is how we would go about calculating $sd(p)$: By definition, $p = \sum X_i / N$ where, $X_i = 1$ if voter $i$ votes for candidate and $0$ otherwise. Since, we sampled the voters at random, we could assume that $X_i$ is a i.i.d Bernoulli random variable. Therefore, $$ Var(P) = V\left( \sum\frac{X_i}{N}\right) = \frac{\sum V(X_i)}{N^2} = \frac{N \pi (1-\pi)}{N^2} = \frac{\pi (1-\pi)}{N}. $$ Thus, $$ sd(p) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi * (1-\pi)}{N}} $$ Now to estimate margin of error we need to know $\pi$ which we do not know obviously. But, an inspection of the numerator suggests that the 'worst' estimate for $sd(p)$ in the sense that we get the 'largest' standard deviation is when $\pi = 0.5$. Therefore, the worst possible standard deviation is: $$ sd(p) = \sqrt{0.5 * 0.5 / N } = 0.5 / \sqrt{N} $$ So, you see that the margin of error falls off exponentially with $N$ and thus you really do not need very big samples to reduce your margin of error, or in other words $N$ need not be very large for you to obtain a narrow confidence interval. For example, for a 95 % confidence interval (i.e., $k= 1.96$) and $N = 1000$, the confidence interval is: $$ \left[p - 1.96 \frac{0.5}{\sqrt{1000}},~~ p + 1.96 \frac{0.5}{\sqrt{1000}}\right] = [p - 0.03,~~ p + 0.03] $$ As we increase $N$ the costs of polling go up linearly but the gains go down exponentially. That is the reason why pollsters usually cap $N$ at 1000 as that gives them a reasonable error of margin under the worst possible assumption of $\pi = 50\%$.
