 If you carved your distribution (histogram) out of wood, and tried to balance it on your finger, the balance point would be the mean, no matter the shape of the distribution. If you put a stick in the middle of your scatter plot, and attached the stick to each data point with a spring, the resting point of the stick would be your regression line. [1] [1] this would technically be principal components regression. you would have to force the springs to move only "vertically" to be least squares, but the example is illustrative either way.
