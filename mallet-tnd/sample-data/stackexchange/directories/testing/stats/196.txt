 Besides gnuplot and ggobi , what open source tools are people using for visualizing multi-dimensional data? Gnuplot is more or less a basic plotting package. Ggobi can do a number of nifty things, such as: animate data along a dimension or among discrete collections animate linear combinations varying the coefficients compute principal components and other transformations visualize and rotate 3 dimensional data clusters use colors to represent a different dimension What other useful approaches are based in open source and thus freely reusable or customizable? Please provide a brief description of the package's abilities in the answer.
