 I think the dominant effect might actually be the fact that the salt you add might not be at boiling temperature. But this is just based on the fact that the boiling-point elevation due to salt in water is actually quite low for typical amounts of salt used in cooking, say. I'm not too familiar with the second effect you mention though.
