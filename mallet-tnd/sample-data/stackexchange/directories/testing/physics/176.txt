 Because a reversible process must not increase the entropy in the system. Any change due to lack of equilibrium will lead to an increase in entropy, and thus irreversibility. You can visualize this by thinking of two bottles, one full of gas and one with vacuum. If the bottles were to be connected, atoms would randomly migrate between the two bottles leading to a system with the gas divided between the containers with equal pressure. Thus, the disorder of the system has increased, because the atoms that were all sorted in one bottle initially are now subdivided in two partitions of a much larger volume. In other words, the lack of equilibrium in pressure leads to an uniformization of the same, and to an irreversible increase in entropy.
