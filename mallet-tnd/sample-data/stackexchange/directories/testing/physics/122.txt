 I learned today in class that photons and light are quantized. I also remember that electric charge is quantized as well. I was thinking about these implications, and I was wondering if (rest) mass was similarly quantized. That is, if we describe certain finite irreducible masses $x$, $y$, $z$, etc., then all masses are integer multiples of these irreducible masses. Or do masses exist along a continuum, as charge and light were thought to exist on before the discovery of photons and electrons? (I'm only referring to invariant/rest mass.)
