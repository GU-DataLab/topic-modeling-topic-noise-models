 Just some quick ideas.. the question is fairly intriguing: i'm gonna think about it again. First law of Newton: i think that those dry ice containers that mimics the motion without friction can be found quite cheaply and can be very useful: If set in motion it will keep going If connected to a dynamometer from one side and an eletric mini4WD in the other side can demonstrate (with no math at all.. just common sense) that an object stay still not only if no forces are acting upon it but also if the sum of the force actin on an object is zero Second Law: using the same electic mini 4WD as before, measure witha dynamometer the force of the of the motor (u already did that in the previous experiment ;) ) and then vary the mass of the car. It will be quite evident (always thank to the common sense) that the heaviest car will accelerate less than the other.. Third law: take two object of similar but not equal mass and compress a spring between them: when you will release (yeah at the same time would be better:P ) them both of them will move in opposite direction.. that can be quite trickier to explain but the experimental evidence shuold be quite visible!
