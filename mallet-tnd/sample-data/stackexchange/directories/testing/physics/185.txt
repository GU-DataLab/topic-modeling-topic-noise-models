 As I understand the Higg's boson can be discovered by the LHC because the collisions are done at an energy that is high enough to produce it and because the luminosity will be high enough also. But what is needed to claim a real "discovery" ? I guess there is not one event saying "hey, that's an Higg's boson" ... I also guess that this was the same kind of situation when the top quark was discovered. How does it work ? Edit: There is a nice introduction to the subject on this page of the CMS experiment , and the various ways to detect it, for example through the following process.
