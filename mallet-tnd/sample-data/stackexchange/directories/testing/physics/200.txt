 Brief answer: Read only the bold part (and ignore grammar then). The answer you already mentioned lies in Quantum Field Theory (QFT). But to fully understand it, you must give up a particle as a point-like thing that is well-localized . There is one Quantum Field per sort of particle , e.g. the electron field for all electrons, and the photon field for all photons. (The fact that there is a single field for all electrons also results in the Pauli exclusion principle .) What you consider a particle is basically just a local peak in the respective particle field , but one cannot even say "This peak corresponds to electron A, this one to B". Now QFT, more specifically Quantum Electrodynamcis ( QED ), describes the local interaction between the electron field and the photon field . But since the fields have a dynamic, a local change induced in the photon field by the electron field will propagate with the speed of light (flat space assumed) and interact with the electron field in another place, thus creating the impression "Electron A emitted a photon that told electron B to interact electromagnetically". It's similar for the other interactions, there's a gluon field for the strong interaction ( Quantum Chromodynamics ), and for the electroweak interaction there's kind of a combination of the photon field and the weak-interaction-bosons.
