 I'm not a particle physicist, but here's a little overview from what I understand. Colliding particles, in particular hadrons (being composed of three quarks and a field of gluons), are quite capable of generating very "messy" collisions, the more so at higher energies. By "messy" I mean that the variations on the possible results of the collision (the number of different Feynmann diagrams) is pretty large. Of course, certain outcomes have much higher outcomes than others, and the probabilities of such can be estimated in quantum field theory. In any case, there can be decays into all sorts of fundamental particles (with different charges, spins, masses, etc.), and then further decays, and so forth. Verifying that a particle (here the Higgs boson) is really what the theory predicts takes lots of runs of the experiment, and is largely just a complex probability game. Given that the properties of the Higgs aren't exactly known, what particle physicists are looking for is signs of a missing particle . i.e. A violation of some conservation law in the collision (typically energy or momentum). This is a good hint that there's an unknown particle that hasn't been accounted for. (For example, neutrinos are far too weakly interacting to be detected directly, and were first discovered by noticing some small energy was missing). At the moment, all we really know from previous experimental data is that the lower bound for the Higgs boson mass is 115 GeV/cÂ² - pretty high, but theoretically well within the range of the LHC. This helps us a bit in knowing where to look, but at the end of the day, it's smashing together protons over and over again that rather crudely gives you the final discovery!
