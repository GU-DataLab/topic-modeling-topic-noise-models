 The main problem here is this: Newton gives us formulas for a force, or a field, if you like. Einstein gives us more generic equations from which to derive gravitational formulas. In this context, one must first find a solution to Einstein's equations. This is represented by a formula. This formula is what might, or may not, be approximately equal to Newton's laws. This said, as answered elsewhere, there is one solution which is very similar to Newton's. It's a very important solution which describes the field in free space. You can find more about this formula -- in lingo it's a metric, here: The fact that they are approximations fundamentally arises from different factros: the fact that they are invariant laws under a number of transformations, but mostly special relativity concerns - in other words, no action at a distance - is a big one.
