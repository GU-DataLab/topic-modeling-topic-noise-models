 The answers in this question: What is spin as it relates to subatomic particles? do not address some particular questions regarding the concept of spin: How are some useful ways to imagine a particle without dimensions - like an electron - to spin? How are some useful ways to imagine a particle with spin 1/2 to make a 360Â° turn without returning to it's original position (the wave function transforms as: $\Psi \rightarrow -\Psi$). When spin is not a classical property of elementary particles, is it a purely relativistic property, a purely quantum-mechanical property or a mixture of both?
