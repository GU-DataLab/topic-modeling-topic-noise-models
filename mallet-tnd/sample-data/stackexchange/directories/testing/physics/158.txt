 The ionized particles from mainly solar wind are caught and trapped by Earth magnetic field, which behaves like a magnetic bottle. (The region in which ions are trapped is called Van Allen radiation belts.) This trap is weaker in the polar regions, and there the ions are mainly released into the denser parts of atmosphere. There they collide with air particles (mostly N$_2$ and O$_2$) causing their fluorescence seen as the northern lights.
