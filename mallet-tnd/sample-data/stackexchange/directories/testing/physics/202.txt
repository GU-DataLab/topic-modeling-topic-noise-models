 I just came from a class on Fourier Transformations as applied to signal processing and sound. It all seems pretty abstract to me, so I was wondering if there were any physical systems that would behave like a Fourier transformation. That is, if given a wave, a purely physical process that would "return" the Fourier transform in some meaningful way. Like, you gave it a sound wave and you would see, "Oh, there are a lot of components of frequency 1kHz...a few of frequency 10kHz...some of 500Hz..." I've seen things happening where, if you put sand on a speaker, the sand would start to form patterns on the speakers that are related to the dominant wavelengths/fundamental frequencies of the sound. Is this some sort of natural, physical fourier transform?
