 Suppose you and I have a conversation from a long distance away. We're at rest with respect to each other and communicate much faster than light. I say "How are you", and you wait a short time and say, "I'm fine thanks." From our point of view, you were responding to my question. However, from a reference frame moving from me to you at relativistic speed, your clock is significantly ahead of mine (a relativistic effect). This means that although you thought you received the message shortly after I sent it, in this frame you didn't. You actually received the message at an earlier time (before I sent it), but you thought it was later because your clock is ahead. From your and my point of view, the order of events is I say "How are you?" You hear me say "How are you?" You pause a short time. You say, "I'm fine thanks." I hear you say, "I'm fine thanks." From the frame moving from me to you, the order of events is You hear me say "How are you?" You pause a short time. You say "I'm fine thanks." I say, "How are you?" I hear you say, "I'm fine thanks." The fact that the order of events changes between reference frames is simply part of relativity, with or without faster-than-light communication. However, it seems strange in this scenario because you are responding to me. Presumably, if I had said, "Where are my car keys?", you would have chosen a different response than "I'm fine thanks." How then is it possible that you responded to my greeting before I uttered it, at least in some frame? I'm not sure if this "violates causality", but it's unintuitive.
