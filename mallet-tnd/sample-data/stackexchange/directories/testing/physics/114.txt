 What happens if you lean on bike while trying to ride straight? It happens that you turn on same side you lean. Why, because you have to generate centrifugal force and lean back up if you do not want to fall down. So if you lean left you have to make left turn in order to generate force which will turn you straight position. If you turn too much left you will eventually fall on right because of too much centrifugal force kicking you other side.
