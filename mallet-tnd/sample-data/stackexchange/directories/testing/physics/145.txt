 I was wondering if anyone put together a law to describe the rising temperature of the water coming out of a tap. The setup is fairly simple: there's a water tank at temperature T, a metal tube of length L connected to it and a tap at the end where temperature is measured. The water flows at P l/s. Given that the metal tube is at room temperature initially, what law describes the temperature of the water at any instant? What is the limit temperature of the water? Thanks.
