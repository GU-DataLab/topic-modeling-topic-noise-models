 I've finally figured it out. First, let's define precisely what it means for some quantity to be absolute or relative. In the context in question, it has to do with whether a quantity is absolute (that is, has the same value) or relative (that is, has different values) when measured by two inertial observers moving with respect to one another. Of course, first we need to define what an inertial observer is: it's an observer for which Newton's laws are applicable without having to resort to adding fictitious forces. Ok, so now we have two observers, Alice and Bob, both of which are inertial. They both observe the motion of some object. Let the index 1 correspond to quantities measured in A's reference frame and the index 2 correspond to quantities measured in B's reference frame. The position of the object is clearly a relative concept, since r₂ = r₁ + u t (where u is the velocity of Bob with respect to Alice, and is constant since they're both inertial observers). Note that the time, t, is the same for both observers, as it must be according to Newtonian Mechanics. The object position is a relative concept because r₂ ≠ r₁. Now, take the time-derivative of both sides and we get v₂ = v₁ + u that is, the velocity of the object with respect to one observer is different than the velocity of the same object with respect to the other observer. Hence, velocity is a relative quantity in Newtonian Mechanics. Next, take the time-derivative of both sides once again, and we obtain a₂ = a₁ (since u is constant). Thus, the acceleration of the object is the same in both reference frames. Acceleration, therefore, is absolute in Newtonian Mechanics. When we take into account the theory of relativity, then time flows at different rates for different inertial observers and the result above for the acceleration is no longer true.
