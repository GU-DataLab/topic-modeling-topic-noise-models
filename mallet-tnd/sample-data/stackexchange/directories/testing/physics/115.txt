 I have an Hamiltonian problem whose 2D phase space exhibit islands of stability (elliptic fixed points). I can calculate the area of these islands in some cases, but for other cases I would like to use Mathematica (or anything else) to compute it numerically. The phase space looks like that : This is a contour plot make with Mathematica. Could anyone with some knowledge of Mathematica provide a way to achieve this ?
