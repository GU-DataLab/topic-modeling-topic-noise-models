 I am looking for a book about "advanced" classical mechanics. By advanced I mean a book considering directly Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation, and also providing a firm basis in the geometrical consideration related to these to formalism (like tangent bundle, cotangent bundle, 1-form, 2-form, etc.). I have this book from Saletan and Jose , but I would like to go into more details about the [symplectic] geometrical and mathematical foundations of classical mechanics. Additional note: A chapter about relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics would be a good thing.
