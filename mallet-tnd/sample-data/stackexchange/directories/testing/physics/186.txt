 We have to analyze this video Givens: An applied net torque due to the wind on the windmill is equal to 1500 N*m. Each (of the 3) propeller props weighs approximately 45 Kg and has a Moment of Inertial equal to about 65% of that of a rod of the same mass being spun about its end. This torque is applied for approximately 45 seconds before the explosion, prior to which the windmill was at rest. Question: What was the angular acceleration caused by the torque? So here's my attempt at it: T=Ia (a is alpha) T=ML^2/3 * a * .65 (due to the whole 65% thing. Actually not sure if I should put 3*M for each propeller) And so this is where I get stuck. I'm not given L, so I'm not sure how to work around this. I could also use $T=1/2MR^2\times a$, but then I dont know R.
