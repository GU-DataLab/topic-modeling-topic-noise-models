 It is technically impossible to measure the speed of such a particle directly; and it all depend on "which" neutrino you are talking about. The speed is related to the momentum and the momentum to the energy. So you can have a neutrino of some MeV of total energy, another one of some GeV, etc. But in any cases, the answer will be "very very close" to c. In all cases neutrinos can be considered as ultra relativistic: their total energy is much higher than their rest energy: $E_t &gt;&gt; m_0 c^2$. In that case, this relation holds: $E = p c$ where $ p = \gamma m_0 v$. The problem is that $m_0$ is not know with a high precision, it is of the order of the eV. You can do the math inserting a plausible energy for a solar neutrino, or for a neutrino coming from a high energy collision process, taking any reasonable value for the rest mass. Edit: To fix the ideas, the rest mass can be something of the order of 0.1 eV and a typical solar neutrino can be of the order of 10 MeV. That's a $\gamma = 10^8$ !
