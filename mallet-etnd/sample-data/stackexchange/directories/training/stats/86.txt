 Unlike a regular variable, a random variable may not be substituted for a single, unchanging value. Rather statistical properties such as the distribution of the random variable may be stated. The distribution is a function that provides the probability the variable will take on a given value, or fall within a range given certain parameters such as the mean or standard deviation. Random variables may be classified as discrete if the distribution describes values from a countable set, such as the integers. The other classification for a random variable is continuous and is used if the distribution covers values from an uncountable set such as the real numbers.
