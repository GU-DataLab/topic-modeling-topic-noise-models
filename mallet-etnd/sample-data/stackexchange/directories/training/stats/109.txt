 Following one-way ANOVA, there are many possible follow-up multiple comparison tests. Holm's test (or better, the Holm-Sidak) test has lots of power, but because it works in a stepwise manner, it cannot compute confidence intervals. Its advantage over the tests than can compute confidence intervals (Tukey, Dunnett) is that is has more power. But is it fair to say that the Holm method always has more power than the methods of Tukey and Dunnet? Or does it depend...?
