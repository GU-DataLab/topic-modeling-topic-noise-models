 When I teach very basic statistics to Secondary School Students I talk about evolution and how we have evolved to spot patterns in pictures rather than lists of numbers and that data visualisation is one of the techniques we use to take advantage of this fact. Plus I try to talk about recent news stories where statistical insight contradicts what the press is implying, making use of sites like Gapminder to find the representation before choosing the story.
