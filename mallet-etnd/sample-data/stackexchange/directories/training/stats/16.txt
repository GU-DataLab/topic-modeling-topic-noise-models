 Two projects spring to mind: Bugs - taking (some of) the pain out of Bayesian statistics. It allows the user to focus more on the model and a bit less on MCMC. Bioconductor - perhaps the most popular statistical tool in Bioinformatics. I know it's a R repository, but there are a large number of people who want to learn R, just for Bioconductor. The number of packages available for cutting edge analysis, make it second to none.
