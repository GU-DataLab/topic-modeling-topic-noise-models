 I have a data set that I'd expect to follow a Poisson distribution, but it is overdispersed by about 3-fold. At the present, I'm modelling this overdispersion using something like the following code in R. Visually, this seems to fit my empirical data very well. If I'm happy with the fit, is there any reason that I should be doing something more complex, like using a negative binomial distribution, as described here ? (If so, any pointers or links on doing so would be much appreciated). Oh, and I'm aware that this creates a slightly jagged distribution (due to the multiplication by three), but that shouldn't matter for my application. Update: For the sake of anyone else who searches and finds this question, here's a simple R function to model an overdispersed poisson using a negative binomial distribution. Set d to the desired mean/variance ratio: (via the R mailing list: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2002-June/022425.html )
