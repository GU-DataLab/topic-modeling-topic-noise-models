 I have two groups of data. Each with a different distribution of multiple variables. I'm trying to determine if these two groups' distributions are different in a statistically significant way. I have the data in both raw form and binned up in easier to deal with discrete categories with frequency counts in each. What tests/procedures/methods should I use to determine whether or not these two groups are significantly different and how do I do that in SAS or R (or Orange)?
