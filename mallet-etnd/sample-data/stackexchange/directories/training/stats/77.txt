 Sometimes correlation is enough. For example, in car insurance, male drivers are correlated with more accidents, so insurance companies charge them more. There is no way you could actually test this for causation. You cannot change the genders of the drivers experimentally. Google has made hundreds of billions of dollars not caring about causation. To find causation, you generally need experimental data, not observational data. Though, in economics, they often use observed "shocks" to the system to test for causation, like if a CEO dies suddenly and the stock price goes up, you can assume causation. Correlation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causation. To show causation requires a counter-factual.
