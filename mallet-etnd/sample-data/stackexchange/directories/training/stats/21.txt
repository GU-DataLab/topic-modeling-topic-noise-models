 What are some of the ways to forecast demographic census with some validation and calibration techniques? Some of the concerns: Census blocks vary in sizes as rural areas are a lot larger than condensed urban areas. Is there a need to account for the area size difference? if let's say I have census data dating back to 4 - 5 census periods, how far can i forecast it into the future? if some of the census zone change lightly in boundaries, how can i account for that change? What are the methods to validate census forecasts? for example, if i have data for existing 5 census periods, should I model the first 3 and test it on the latter two? or is there another way? what's the state of practice in forecasting census data, and what are some of the state of the art methods?
