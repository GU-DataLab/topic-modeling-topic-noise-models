 For example, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used in the WMAP [1] papers, the most important measurment/papers of modern CMB [2] cosmology, one of the pillars of the Big Bang Theory of the Universe. MCMC was used to explore and fit the parameters of the theory with the WMAP (and other) measurements.
