 As they are not charged, they only interact through their magnetic moment (which at very low energy could lead to kind of Van der Waals forces , the strong force and the weak force. If you try to create a nucleon-nucleon system and that you do some QM calculations using an Hamiltonian taking into account the nuclear force, the electric force and the spin 1/2 of the nucleons you will have different contribution to the total energy, some being positive, other negative. For example, in the proton-proton case you cannot have a bound state because the electric repulsion is stronger. You also have a contribution that depend on the [projection of the] spin of the nucleons. If they are equal the contribution lower the energy of the system and you can have a bound state. That's the case of the deuton (a proton-neutron bound stage, very weak). But in the neutron-neutron state, both being of spin 1/2, you cannot have the same projection, and thus you cannot obtain a bound state. If you interpret that as "they repel each other" then you have your explanation.
