 I'm trying to figure out how to remember that hardness: how resistant it is to deformation toughness: how resistant it is to brittle failures stress: force on a surface area strength: ability to withstand stress without failure strain: measurement of deformation of a material Does anyone know of a mnemonic or easy way? I only know these from googling them, and I'm finding it tricky to remember them.
