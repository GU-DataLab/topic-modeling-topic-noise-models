 When you accelerate charged particles, they lose energy by emitting photons (a process called "Bremsstrahlung" or "braking radiation"). This is a nuisance in particle accelerators, because (1) you want to impart as much energy as possible to the particles being accelerated (that's the point!) and this is a loss; and (2) the bremsstrahlung can be in the form of harmful (to people and machines) ionizing radiation. Stronger magnets are also necessary to produce the tighter turns. Acceleration in the beam direction is, of course, unavoidable. But any time you have motion along a curved path, you also need acceleration perpendicular to the direction of motion in order to curve the trajectory. In order to minimize this acceleration perpendicular to the direction of motion, it is desirable to have the accelerator be as straight as possible. If you are building a machine that accelerates particles along a closed path, this means you want to make the radius as big as possible. (I assume that, if you do the math, it turns out that a circular path (with uniform curvature) is better than an elliptical one, or one with long straightaways followed by tight turns.) An alternative is to build a linear accelerator, which simply accelerates particles in a straight line. The Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) is one such accelerator; and the International Linear Collider is in the planning phases. Why is the LHC 27 km in circumference? Because they are re-using the tunnels from the Large Electronâ€“Positron Collider (LEP), which was 27 km around. Why was LEP 27 km around? It was almost certainly a balance between the science goals and the money available (longer tunnels = more expensive). Check out the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) on Wikipedia, the doomed American successor to LEP. It was going to be 87 km in circumference.
