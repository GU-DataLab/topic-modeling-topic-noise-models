 You can get two photons entangled, and send them off in different directions; this is what happens in EPR experiments. Is the entanglement then somehow affected if one puts a thick slab of EM shielding material between the entangled photons? Have such experiments been made? According to EPR experiments measurements of the entangled states are at odds with SR, so based on that I'd assume the answer is "no"/"don't know", but any citations would be appreciated!
