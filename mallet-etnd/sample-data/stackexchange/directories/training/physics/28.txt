 It is worth remembering that in at velocities close to c. A particle kinetic energy is inter-wind with its rest mass. So the actual energy equation is $E = \sqrt{p^2c^2+m^2c^4}$ So the energy of a collision is the sum of the above energy for the two colliding particles. That is why you construct improved accelerators. As it is the only way to tune up the energy. To the extend of my knowledge we don't how to tune up mass.
