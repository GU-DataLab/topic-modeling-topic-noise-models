 String theory should come with a proposal for an experiment, and make some predictions about the results of the experiment; then we could check against the real results. If a theory cannot come with any predictions, then it will disprove itself little by little ... The problem is that, with string theory, this is extremely difficult to do, and string theorists have year in front of them to go in that direction; but if in 100 years we are still at the same status, then it would be a proof that string theory is unfruitful...
