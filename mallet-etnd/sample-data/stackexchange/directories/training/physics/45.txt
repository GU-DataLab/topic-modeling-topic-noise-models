 I think your question is divided in two parts. When talking about energy, in the field of HEP or accelerator physics we can talk about total energy kinetic energy momentum As for elementary particles relativistic effects manifest themselves almost all the time, you need to use a relativistic form for the energy: $$E = \sqrt{p^2c^2+m^2c^4}$$ Instead of a bare $E = p^2/2m$ (as in classical mechanics, where $p = m v$). This relation as two parts: one depending on the momentum and one (constant) given by the mast of the particle. It should be also noted that for ultra-relativistic cases, where $E \gg E_0$, we have $E = p c$. Usually for low energy applications, like linear accelerators or low energy experiments we talk about the kinetic energy, which is $E_k = \sqrt{p^2c^2+m^2c^4} - mc^2$. For example if you talk about protons of 160 MeV obviously it is kinetic energy, as the rest mass of the proton is rhougly 1 GeV. For higher energy application usually you can make the ultra-relativistic approximation and you then talk about total energy (in eV) or about the momentum in $\mathrm{eV}/c$; taking $c=1$, both are numerically equal. When you are not sure about which approximation you can take, it is better to explain which one you take. Example: For a proton in the LHC with a momentum of 3.5 TeV/c you can calculate its total energy which is ... How is this energy "calculated"? (I assume you meant "experimentally" or something like that.) In HEP physics we use what we call electron-volt as a unit of energy. A particle of unit charge will have an energy of 1 eV if it descends from rest a potential difference of 1 V. So for example, when you accelerate protons in the LHC, if you have cavities giving you 10 MV, the particle will gain 10 MeV every turns.
