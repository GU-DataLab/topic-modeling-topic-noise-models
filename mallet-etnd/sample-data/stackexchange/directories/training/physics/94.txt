 Measuring the polarization of a laser beam is a simple enough task if the polarization is the same everywhere. You can even buy commercial polarimeters. How do you go about it if the light beam has different polarizations in different parts of the transverse plane? One example is a radially polarized beam. More generally, is there a good technique for sampling the local polarization (which might be linear, elliptical, or circular, anywhere on the Poincar√© sphere ) in one transverse plane?
