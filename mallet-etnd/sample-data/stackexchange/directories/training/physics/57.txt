 Another important use of Monte-Carlo is in nuclear engineering: basically for two distinct things: nuclear reactor core calculations and radiation shielding. The first use Monte-Carlo to obtain precise estimations of the reactivity of the core (and other parameters) and the second allow to calculate, for example, the thickness of a shielding. More generally this is related to particle-matter interaction : this is a process where each interaction is quantified by its cross-section which then gives a probability for the interaction to occur. This is thus a very good field to apply MC methods. Another example is in medical physics, for the calculation of the deposited dose on a patient.
