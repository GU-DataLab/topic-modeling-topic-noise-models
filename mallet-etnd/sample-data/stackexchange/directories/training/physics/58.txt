 As KennyTM stated, use the conservation of energy. Say for example you have a constant electric field E to accelerate your particle of charge q and mass m, this will mean that the electrical energy E d q accumulated over the distance d will convert entirely into kinetic energy $\frac12 m v^2$ (assuming you stay non-relativistic, otherwise it's $\sqrt{m^2c^4+p^2c^2}$). Just solve the equation for v (or the momentum p in the relativistic case). Things get a bit more complicated for a non-static EM field.
