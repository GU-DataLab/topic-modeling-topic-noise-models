 First, from your comment: a magnetic field will never accelerate anything (I am more specifically thinking about a charge "particle" as this is trivial for a golf ball) ( Edit : see the comments bellow about that statement). The magnetic field is always perpendicular to the trajectory, thus giving no contribution in a change of the kinetic energy. To accelerate a particle, you need an electric field. Then the way to proceed is the following: if you know the electric field and the path, you can integrate E dot dx and multiply by the charge. This will give you an energy difference, and this energy is added as kinetic energy, thus from the kinetic energy, if you are non relativistic you can use $E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ and make a difference.
