 Physicists often refer to the energy of collisions between different particles. My question is: how is that energy calculated? Is that kinetic energy? Also, related to this question, I know that the aim is to have higher and higher energy collisions (e.g to test for Higgs Boson). My understanding is that to have higher energy you can either accelerate them more, or use particles with higher mass. Is this correct?
