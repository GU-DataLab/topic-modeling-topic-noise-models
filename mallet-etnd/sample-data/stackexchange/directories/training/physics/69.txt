 The short answer is that measurement and interactions are two different animals in Quantum Mechanics. In reality measurements are performed using one of the fundamental interactions (usually EM), but this does not enter the framework of QM. The long answer is that you will not receive a satisfying answer to your question. First, because physicists don't know the answer, and second, because physicists don't care. Physics is concerned with understanding nature, in so far as making predictions regarding measurements. If we have a theory of what happens between measurements (things like Lagrangians and forces) and a theory of measurements (a postulate in Quantum Mechanics that wave functions collapse, plus the probabilistic interpretation of the abs.square of the wave function), and this framework works to the desired accuracy, then the philosophical implications of trying to unite the two are of no interest to physicists, unless they bring about a deeper understanding of nature, in so far as making more precise or more general predictions regarding measurements. In practice, the line of questioning you pose has been investigated ever since the advent of Quantum Mechanics, but to my knowledge, nothing ever came of it regarding unification of forces and measurements ("don't know"), so the mainstream has lost interest a long time ago ("don't care"). (As an interesting side-note, one important result to come out of related type of inquiry is the Bell inequality.) Sorry if this answer seems negative. To quote David Mermin [corrected] regarding the philosophical issues regarding Quantum Mechanics, the pragmatic thing to do is to "shut up and calculate!"
