 There have been recent results in mathematics regarding Conformal field theories and topological field theories. I am curious about the reaction to such results in the physics community. So I guess a starting place for a question would be something like: Did Atiyah's axiomatization of TQFT capture what physicists feel are important in QFT's? How many more parameters are there to what a physicist would call a QFT or FT in general? Perhaps I should mention that mathematicians (the ones who dont know any phsyics) think about various Field Theories as things that assign invariants to manifolds that should be sensitive to certain data (depending on the word proceeding field). A lot has been done when you only care about the basic topology of the Manifold you are evalutating your field theory at. Have mathematicians gotten rid of too much for physicists to care? What types of things do physicists want a Field theory to keep track of, what kind of structure on the manifold that is?
