 I think that, as always, there is a significant disconnect between the math and physics camps. However, physicists probably realize that the topological partition function of the B-model at genus g is not easy to calculate and doesn't have a good mathematical definition, in the holomorphic limit or not. That is, they would be likely to agree that mathematicians like Costello have done valuable work in trying to nail down this elusive quantity. Physicists working in topological field theory are pretty comfortable with the Atiyah-Segal axioms and with theories of various depths/levels. Kapustin, for example, has spoken widely about these points (categories and 2-categories of branes).
