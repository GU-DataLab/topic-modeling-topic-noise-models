 The calculation of the Coriolis force is dependent on latitude: $F = m a$ where $a = 2 \Omega sin(lat)$, with $\Omega$ being the Earth's angular velocity $m$ is the mass of the object in question The Earth's angular velocity is (about) $7.29 \times 10^{-5}$ rad/sec So, for a sink with a couple gallons of water in it at 45 degrees north... the Coriolis force is about $7.57 \times 2 \times 7.29 \times 10^{-5} = 1.10 \times 10^{-3}$ N. Interesting reading about this over this way , and (of course) here .
