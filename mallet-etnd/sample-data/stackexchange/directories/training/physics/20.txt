 In general usage, "sound" refers to our perception of the vibrations of particles (atoms, molecules) in some medium, typically air or water, though sound waves can travel through any medium. Vibrations are produced whenever objects cause the particles in the medium to oscillate, e.g. clapping your hands together, beating a drum, or yelling. Sound can be measured the way it is heard - just as air molecules begin to vibrate in the presence of a vibrating object - the air molecules can cause other things to vibrate (such as our eardrums, or a part of a microphone) and we can quantify the level of sound by measuring the motion of the detector in any number of ways. At a deeper level, sound waves are the "Goldstone modes" corresponding to broken translational symmetry of the surrounding medium. Let me try to bring this a little more down to earth. Think about a parcel of air, large enough to contain a lot of air molecules, but not so large that there are sizable air currents swirling within. We can think of this in an ideal situation as being a fluid of uniform density. This fluid has translational symmetry - if I translate it a little in any direction, it looks more or less the same "in the bulk". Translational symmetry is a continuous symmetry, so I can squeeze the air in a spatially-varying way. It turns out that if I do this in a wavelike pattern with a long wavelength, this is an excitation that costs very little energy, and hence will be important to the physics. These waves are precisely sound waves. This probably doesn't make much sense as I've written it, so I may try to edit this a bit later on if anyone is actually interested in this point of view.
