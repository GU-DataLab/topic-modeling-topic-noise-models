 Much of how you answer this question comes down to your view of the wavefunction or state. If you think that the quantum state is a state of reality (that is, an ontic state), then you must either reproduce the predictions of orthodox (Copenhagen) QM without the measurement postulate or you must explain why nature provides two forms of evolution. The former view is basically the Many Worlds Interpretation, which I feel a great degree of attraction to, as it postulates only unitary evolution, and explains measurement as being an emergent, rather than fundamental, effect. On the other hand, if you hold that the wavefunction is a state of knowledge (epistemic) about some other underlying ontic state, then measurement collapse represents not a true evolution, but a discontinuous change in your knowledge about a system. Alternative formulations of quantum mechanics, such as Bohmian mechanics, explain this in a mathematically rigorous way, but that some find unsatisfying. Each of these approaches (and the many more I didn't mention) suggests where to look for the next physical theory, and so the question should eventually be experimentally decidable. For now, though, we must rely on mathematics, physical intuition and rational argument.
