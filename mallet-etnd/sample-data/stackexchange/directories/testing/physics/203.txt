 Your ear is an effective Fourier transformer. An ear contains many small hair cells. The hair cells differ in length, tension, and thickness, and therefore respond to different frequencies. Different hair cells are mechanically linked to ion channels in different neurons, so different neurons in the brain get activated depending on the Fourier transform of the sound you're hearing. A piano is a Fourier analyzer for a similar reason. A prism or diffraction grating would be a Fourier analyzer for light. It spreads out light of different frequencies, allowing us to analyze how much of each frequency is present in a given source.
