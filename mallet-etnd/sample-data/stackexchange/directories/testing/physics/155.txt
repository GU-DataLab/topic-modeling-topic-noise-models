 I think this may be a summary of other answers, but there are a couple things going on here. First, neutrons are electrically neutral, so an obvious force is the Van der Waals force. However, due to quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle (as noted above), neutrons' wave functions cannot (ish) overlap and so they are subject to the Neutron Degeneracy Pressure . I think if you understand these two concepts, then you should have a fairly good grasp on what is going on between neutrons in a neutron star.
