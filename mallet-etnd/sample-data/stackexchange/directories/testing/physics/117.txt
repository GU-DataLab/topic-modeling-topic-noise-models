 I think it is correct your appreciation if Gauss law holds in a two dimensional world, then the electrostatic force should be inversely proportional to the distance between charges. However, I'm not at all convinced that Gauss law could be true in a two-dimensional world because $F_{q}=k \displaystyle \frac{qq'(r-r')}{|r-r'|^{3}}$ is a consequence of a 3-dimensional space and since we derive Gauss law from such a force law (to be precise, from its electric field), we can not assume the validity of Gauss law independently from a 3-dimensional space.
