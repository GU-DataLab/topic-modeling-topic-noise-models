 Interactions merely involve a correlation developing. For example, if an electron is put through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, a correlation develops between the distance travelled in the x direction and the distance deviated in the y direction. It is reversible. The measurement which occurs when the particle hits the photographic plate is irreversible. It is associated with irreversible dissipation, i.e. entropy generation. This approximation can itself be dissected further, but it gets very tricky. A really good (1983) book is by Wheeler and Zurek, "The quantum theory of measurement" available as a djvu file at eds _Quan.html (8 MB, wait 30 sec for the download). [Now if I can only figure out how to work a reader for a Mac ...]
