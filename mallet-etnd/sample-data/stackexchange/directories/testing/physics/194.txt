 An important point about relativity is that it is not quite like the physics you learn in an introductory physics class. There, you learn about Newton's Laws or Snell's Law or Lenz's Law, etc. Those are all laws that tell things how to act; they tell mass how to respond to force, or light how to bend, or currents which way to run. Relativity is different in that it provides a set of meta-laws, or laws that the other laws of physics must obey. It doesn't directly tell things what to do. The classic example is Maxwell's Equations. These are laws that tell charged particles and electromagnetic fields how to act. It turns out that these laws obey a certain mathematical criterion, called "Lorentz Invariance", that is required by relativity. So Maxwell's equations are good relativistic laws. They obey the meta-laws. On the other hand, Newton's laws (of motion) are not good relativistic laws. They don't obey the meta-laws. So in relativity, we need a slightly new set of laws to describe how mass responds to force. As for what the meta-laws are, they were outlined by Nick Gotch as "basic ideas" above. Those basic ideas turn out to be equivalent to Lorentz invariance.
