 Climate modelling is a giant science of its own, and the proportion of CFD/statistics depends on the particular model. In general, what models do is first a simple (often uncompressable) large-scale CFD to advect the scalar fields and then apply a bunch of subrutines simulating small scale and more complex processes, like radiation transfers, heat transfers, cloud dynamics, precipitation, evatranspiration and interactions with land/ocean. Those are mainly governed by some phenomenological theories, based either on some subscale simulations, approximated theories or purely statistical models. The proper construction of that step depends on the purpose of a model and has more to do with art than science (i.e. balancing accuracy and computational time).
