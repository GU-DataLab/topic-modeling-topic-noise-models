 The answer is going to depend on the heat transfer coefficient between the tube and the surrounding room (unless you specify that the tube is held at constant temperature), the heat transfer coefficient between the tube and water, the outside &amp; inside diameter of the tube, and the length of the tube. This is a moderately involved heat transfer problem, unless additional constraints are provided to simplify it. An excellent resource for understanding the mathematics behind this sort of heat transfer problem can be found over here . It's very similar to the solution posted above by @Cedric, but may be a little easier for some to follow.
