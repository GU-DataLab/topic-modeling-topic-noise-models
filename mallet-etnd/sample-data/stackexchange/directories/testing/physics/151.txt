 We can consider the following model: a tube of constant temperature $T_e$ of lenght L, radius $r$ where water is flowing uniformly at a speed $v$ (that you can obtain from your flow $P$). A "slice" of water travels an interval $dx$ in a duration $dt = \frac{dx}{v}$. The tube will contribute to the "heating" of the water by $\frac{dQ}{dt} = (T-T_e) k 2 \pi r dx$ where $k$ is the conductivity and where we use a very simple model (in particular for the radius, we do not distinguish external and internal radii). During this interval the temperature $T(x)$ of the water will vary by $dT = -\frac{dQ}{c \rho dV}$ where $C$ is the heat capacity at constant pressure of water, and where $dV = 2 \pi r dx$. Replacing we have $\frac{dT}{T-T_e}=-\frac{k}{\rho C v} dx$ whose solution, if the temperature in the tank (ie x = 0) is $T_t$ : $T(x) = (T_t - T_e) e^{(-\alpha x)}+T_e$ where $\alpha = \frac{k}{\rho C v}$. Depending on the lenght of the tube you have the temperature at the tap.
