 In standard Newtonian mechanics, acceleration is indeed considered to be an absolute quantity , in that it is not determined relative to any inertial frame of reference (constant velocity). This fact follows directly from the principal that forces are the same everywhere, independent of observer. Of course, if you're doing classical mechanics in an accelerating reference frame, then you introduce a fictitious force, and accelerations are not absolute with respect to an "inertial frame" or other accelerating reference frames - though this is less often considered, perhaps. Note also that the same statement applies to Einstein's Special Relativity. (I don't really understand enough General Relativity to comment, but I suspect it says no, and instead considers other more fundamental things, such as space-time geodesics.)
