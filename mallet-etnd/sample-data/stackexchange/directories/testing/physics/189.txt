 The first thing I would point out to you is that $\tau = \frac{1}{2} MR^2 \alpha$ is really just $\tau = I\alpha$, with a particular choice of $I$. Is that choice appropriate for this problem? (Ask yourself the same thing any other time you consider using $\tau = \frac{1}{2} MR^2\alpha$.) Next, note that the moments of inertia of different parts of the windmill do add up to produce the total, just like with mass. You can't just use the moment of inertia of one propeller prop, you have to calculate the total moment of inertia. Finally, consider this: what information can you get from the video, that could supplement the 3 "givens"? There's no length scale in the video, so you can't measure the length of a prop directly, but there is a time scale. What can you do with that?
