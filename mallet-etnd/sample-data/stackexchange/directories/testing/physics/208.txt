 M = mass of the sun m = mass of the earth r = distance between the earth and the sun The sun is converting mass into energy by nuclear fusion. $F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} \rightarrow r = \frac{GM}{v^2}$ $\Delta E = \Delta M c^2 = (M_{t} - M_{t+\Delta t}) c^2 \rightarrow \Delta M = \Delta E / c^2$ $\rightarrow \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta t} = \frac{G}{v^2 c^2}.\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$ Sun radiates $3.9 × 10^{26} W = \Delta E/\Delta t$ Velocity of the earth $v = 29.8k m/s$ There is nothing that is stopping the earth from moving with the same velocity so for centripetal force to balance gravitational force $r$ must change. Is $r$ increasing? ($\Delta r/ \Delta t = 3.26070717 × 10^{-10} m/s $)
