 One answer might be Benford's law which state that the probability of lediding digit being 1 among natural constants is approx 30% How to interpret Benford's law: Any constant and measurment of "new" phenomen can be in any range. Ok max magnitude for known universe is approx 10^60, but still. Picking random number from this range is not evenly distributed but logarithmic distributed. example: We pick random number from 1 to 10^10 There is equal probability to pick number from 1 to 10^5 and from 10^5 to 10^10, this way we can prove that there is most likely to pick number that begins whit 1 and least likely whit 9. We can check this rule just by looking on logarithmic scale or doing some math. Measuring of earth field, gravity or something else obeys this law and this is the reason that is most likely that you will measure 1*10^n. Other reason that field is 1 gauss is that 1 is just magnitude/order of field. (by the way wikipedia article about this topic says that it is between 0.3 and 0.6 gauss)
