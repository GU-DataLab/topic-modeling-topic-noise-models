 I think the reasoning has an error. It assumes $v$ is constant, but instead we ought to assume the angular momentum is constant. By dimensional analysis that leads to $r \propto \frac{L^2}{GM}$ so as $M$ decreases, $r$ increases (the original post had $r \propto M$, not $r \propto 1/M$. On the other hand, assuming a circular orbit seems dubious. As the other commenters said, this effect is minute. A significant effect on the orbit of the moon around the earth is tidal evolution, which does actually push the moon further away. See
