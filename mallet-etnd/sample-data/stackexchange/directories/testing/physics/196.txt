 I've always heard people saying, "Faster than light information transfer can't happen because it would violate causality! Effects can precede their causes!" However, I'm trying to think of a situation where this would happen. I'm sure it has something to do with relativity or something like that. I sort of understand that people going faster perceive time slower. Can someone help illuminate this for me by showing a scenario where causality is clearly violated due to FTL information transfer?
