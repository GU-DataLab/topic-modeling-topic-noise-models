 The next serious advance that is not an speculative/fringe idea is most likely to be fusion power . Harnessing the power of nuclear fusion has long been a goal for energy production since the first hydrogen bomb was created in the 1950s. Creating controlled fusion, rather than the chaotic variety has proven a rather challenging task here on Earth however. (The sun does it quite easily largely thanks to its huge gravitational field.) Of particular note is the ITER project , currently ongoing in Southern France. It is an international collaborative project with the goal of creating a sustainable fusion reactor that produces net energy. (You can read information on the site for the specific target goals/criteria). This is essentially the last step in the 'proof of concept' stage of sustainable nuclear fusion for providing energy, and is to many looking quite promising. It is however only a scientific experiment still, and nuclear fusion power plants are a bit further off in the future, even given success of ITER. In fact, the proposed successor to ITER is DEMO , a reactor that aims to produce over an order of magnitude more power. Once testing is complete, the idea is to turn it into the world's first fusion power plant. With any luck, this may just be the breakthrough humanity has been waiting for. It will certainly be a revolutionary event whenever it occurs, and likely render fossil fuels totally obsolete.
