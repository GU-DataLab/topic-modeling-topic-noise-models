 I'm a programmer without statistical background, and I'm currently looking at different classification methods for a large number of different documents that I want to classify into pre-defined categories. I've been reading about kNN, SVM and NN. However, I have some trouble getting started. What resources do you recommend? I do know single variable and multi variable calculus quite well, so my math should be strong enough. I also own Bishop's book on Neural Networks, but it has proven to be a bit dense as an introduction.
