 I believe that this calls for a two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test , or the like. The two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is based on comparing differences in the empirical distribution functions (ECDF) of two samples, meaning it is sensitive to both location and shape of the the two samples. It also generalizes out to a multivariate form. This test is found in various forms in different packages in R, so if you are basically proficient, all you have to do is install one of them (e.g. fBasics ), and run it on your sample data.
