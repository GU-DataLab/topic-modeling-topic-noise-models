 If you want to know that a pattern is meaningful, you need to show what it actually means . Statistical tests do not do this. Unless your data can be said to be in some sense "complete", inferences draw from the data will always be provisional. You can increase your confidence in the validity of a pattern by testing against more and more out of sample data, but that doesn't protect you from it turning out to be an artefact. The broader your range of out of sample data -- eg, in terms of how it is acquired and what sort of systematic confounding factors might exist within it -- the better the validation. Ideally, though, you need to go beyond identifying patterns and come up with a persuasive theoretical framework that explains the patterns you've found, and then test that by other, independent means. (This is called "science".)
