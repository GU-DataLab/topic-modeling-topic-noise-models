 I know this must be standard material, but I had difficulty in finding a proof in this form. Let $e$ be a standard white Gaussian vector of size $N$. Let all the other matrices in the following be constant. Let $v = Xy + e$, where $X$ is an $N\times L$ matrix and $y$ is an $N\times 1$ vector, and let $$\left\{\begin{align}&#xD; \bar y &amp;= (X^TX)^{-1}X^Tv\\&#xD; \bar e &amp;= v - X\bar y&#xD; \end{align}\right.\quad.$$ If $c$ is any constant vector, $J = N - \mathrm{rank}(X)$, and $$\left\{\begin{align}&#xD; u &amp;= c^T\bar y\\&#xD; s^2 &amp;= \bar e^T\bar ec^T(X^TX)^{-1}c&#xD; \end{align}\right.\quad,$$ then the random variable defined as $t = u/\sqrt{s^2/J}$ follows a normalized Student's T distribution with J degrees of freedom. I would be grateful if you could provide an outline for its proof.
