 I'm aware that this one is far from yes or no question, but I'd like to know which techniques do you prefer in categorical data analysis - i.e. cross tabulation with two categorical variables. I've come up with: &chi; 2 test - well, this is quite self-explanatory Fisher's exact test - when n &lt; 40, Yates' continuity correction - when n &gt; 40, Cramer's V - measure of association for tables which have more than 2 x 2 cells, &Phi; coefficient - measure of association for 2 x 2 tables, contingency coefficient (C) - measure of association for n x n tables, odds ratio - independence of two categorical variables, McNemar marginal homogeniety test, And my question here is: Which statistical techniques for cross-tabulated data (two categorical variables) do you consider relevant (and why)?
