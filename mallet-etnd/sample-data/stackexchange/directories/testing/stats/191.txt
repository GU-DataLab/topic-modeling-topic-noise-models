 The Bland-Altman plot is more widely known as the Tukey Mean-Difference Plot (one of many charts devised by John Tukey ). The idea is that x-axis is the mean of your two measurements, which is your best guess as to the "correct" result and the y-axis is the difference between the two measurement differences. The chart can then highlight certain types of anomalies in the measurements. For example, if one method always gives too high a result, then you'll get all of your points above or all below the zero line. It can also reveal, for example, that one method over-estimates high values and under-estimates low values. If you see the points on the Bland-Altman plot scattered all over the place, above and below zero, then the suggests that there is no consistent bias of one approach versus the other (of course, there could be hidden biases that this plot does not show up). Essentially, it is a good first step for exploring the data. Other techniques can be used to dig into more particular sorts of behaviour of the measurements.
