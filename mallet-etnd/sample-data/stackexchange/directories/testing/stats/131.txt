 Let me start by saying that I love both languages: you can't go wrong with either, and they are certainly better than something like C++ or Java for doing data analysis. For basic data analysis I would suggest R (especially with plyr). IMO, R is a little easier to learn than Clojure, although this isn't completely obvious since Clojure is based on Lisp and there are numerous fantastic Lisp resources available (such as SICP ). There are less keywords in Clojure, but the libraries are much more difficult to install and work with. Also, keep in mind that R (or S) is largely derived from Scheme, so you would benefit from Lisp knowledge when using it. In general: The main advantage of R is the community on CRAN (over 2461 packages and counting). Nothing will compare with this in the near future, not even a commercial application like matlab. Clojure has the big advantage of running on the JVM which means that it can use any Java based library immediately. I would add that I gave a talk relating Clojure/Incanter to R a while ago, so you may find it of interest. In my experience around creating this, Clojure was generally slower than R for simple operations.
