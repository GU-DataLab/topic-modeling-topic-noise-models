 The simple answer is that Likert scales are always ordinal. The intervals between positions on the scale are monotonic but never so well-defined as to be numerically uniform increments. That said, the distinction between ordinal and interval is based on the specific demands of the analysis being performed. Under special circumstances, you may be able to treat the responses as if they fell on an interval scale. To do this, typically the respondents need to be in close agreement regarding the meaning of the scale responses and the analysis (or the decisions made based on the analysis) should be relatively insensitive to problems that may arise.
