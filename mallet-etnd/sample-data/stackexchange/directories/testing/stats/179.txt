 For a univariate KDE, you are better off using something other than Silverman's rule which is based on a normal approximation. One excellent approach is the Sheather-Jones method, easily implemented in R; for example, The situation for multivariate KDE is not so well studied, and the tools are not so mature. Rather than a bandwidth, you need a bandwidth matrix. To simplify the problem, most people assume a diagonal matrix, although this may not lead to the best results. The ks package in R provides some very useful tools including allowing a full (not necessarily diagonal) bandwidth matrix.
