 The squared difference has nicer mathematical properties; it's continuously differentiable (nice when you want to minimize it), it's a sufficient statistic for the Gaussian distribution, and it's (a version of) the L2 norm which comes in handy for proving convergence and so on. The mean absolute deviation (the absolute value notation you suggest) is also used as a measure of dispersion, but it's not as "well-behaved" as the squared error.
