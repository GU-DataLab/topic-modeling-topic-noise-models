 Following on from this question : Imagine that you want to test for differences in central tendency between two groups (e.g., males and females) on a 5-point Likert item (e.g., satisfaction with life: Dissatisfied to Satisfied). I think a t-test would be sufficiently accurate for most purposes, but that a bootstrap test of differences between group means would often provide more accurate estimate of confidence intervals. What statistical test would you use?
