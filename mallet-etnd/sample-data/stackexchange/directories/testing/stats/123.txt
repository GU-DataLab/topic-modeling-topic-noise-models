 Squaring the difference from the mean has a couple of reasons. Variance is defined as the 2nd moment of the deviation (the R.V here is (x-$\mu$) ) and thus the square as moments are simply the expectations of higher powers of the random variable. Having a square as opposed to the absolute value function gives a nice continuous and differentiable function (absolute value is not differentiable at 0) - which makes it the natural choice, especially in the context of estimation and regression analysis. The squared formulation also naturally falls out of parameters of the Normal Distribution.
