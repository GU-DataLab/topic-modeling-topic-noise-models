 I have 2 ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models, providing me with text transcriptions for my testdata. The error measure I use is Word Error Rate. What methods do I have to test for statistical significance of my new results? An example: I have an experiment with 10 speaker, all having 100 (the same) sentences, total 900 words per speaker. Method A has an WER (word error rate) of 19.0%, Method B 18.5%. How do I test whether Method B is significantly better?
